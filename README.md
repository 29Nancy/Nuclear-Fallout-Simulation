Nuclear Fallout Simulation Using DELFIC and WSEG Models

📖 OVERVIEW

This project is an offline nuclear fallout simulation and visualization system designed to model radioactive fallout dispersion following a surface nuclear detonation. The application estimates fallout plume geometry, radiation dose rates, integrated radiation exposure, and population-level casualties using both physics-based and empirical modeling approaches.

The system is intended for educational, academic, and research purposes, enabling users to study post-detonation fallout behavior without requiring internet connectivity or real-time data sources.


🎯 OBJECTIVES

Simulate radioactive fallout dispersion after a nuclear detonation

Estimate radiation dose rates and integrated doses

Compare physics-based (DELFIC) and empirical (WSEG-10) fallout models

Visualize fallout plumes on an offline map

Assess population exposure and casualty estimates

Provide an interactive tool for post-detonation risk analysis


🧠 MODELS IMPLEMENTED
